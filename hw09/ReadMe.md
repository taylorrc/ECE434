## Project Status
See the eLinux page for Project: Christmas Wreath for updates on milestones. Currently, we are trying to find a good way to start and stop playing music on a USB dongle connected to the bone through python.

*Looks like you made good progress on this Thursday.*

## Google Sheets:

I included a screenshot of the sheet within the hw09Photos folder. The file I used for logging is called demo.py. The temperature is logged every 5 seconds in degrees Fahrenheit. 

## Thingspeak
I included a screenshot of the sheet within the hw09Photos. The file I used for logging is called temp.py. The temperature is logged in degrees Celsius and is captured every 15 seconds.
