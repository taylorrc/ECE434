The Etch-A-Sketch python file is a very simple implementation of the classic Etch-A-Sketch game, using a 2-D array, as well as 
some basic commands as controls. 

Controls:
There are six basic commands for the player to be aware of, that are given when the program starts. 
1. Up--Move the cursor up
2. Down--Move the cursor down
3. Left--Move the cursor left
4. Right--Move the cursor right
5. Shake--Clear the gameboard
6. Exit--Leave the game

If a player attempts to move in a direction that is off the gameboard, the game will register the invalid move and prompt
the player to move again. 

Any space that has been visited by the player is populated with an 'x' and the current spot of the player is denoted by a '|'
