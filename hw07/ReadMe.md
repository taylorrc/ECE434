# Homework 7 
## Ryan Taylor

### Project
Emily and I put all of the necessary links on the eLinux page under "ECE434 Project Christmas Wreath"

### Blynk
I was able to install Blynk on both my phone and the Bone and run a simple example. Eventually, I was able to create a python program called tmp101.py that reads the temperature of a tmp101 sensor from my beagleboard and display the temperature in degrees F on the Blynk app. </br>
</br>
I was also able to add functionality of Blynk to my Etch-a-sketch program. This can be seen in Etch-a-sketch7.py.
